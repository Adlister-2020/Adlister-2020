    <p>Americans spend trillions of dollars each year on new stuff,
        billions each year on storage units, and every day,
        they throw tons of their stuff away.</p>
    <p>In all that buying, storing, and tossing, Nick Huzar and
        Arean van Veelen saw opportunity. Could a new kind of local marketplace
        bring people together to get more value out of all that stuff? Could that
        value exchange start with something as simple as a photo from a smartphone?
        Inspired to reimagine the model for local, peer-to-peer commerce,
        Nick and Arean founded OfferUp, a marketplace on a mission to become the simplest,
        most trustworthy local buying and selling experience. Our Team</p>
